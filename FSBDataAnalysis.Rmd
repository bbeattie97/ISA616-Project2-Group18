# FSB Data Analysis: Group 17b {.unnumbered}

# Research Question {.unnumbered}

**"What are the macro placement and salay trends FSB is seeing over the past three years"**

-   Are our placement results going up / down / steady?
-   Salary trends?
-   Kirk would like to see this for FSB overall as well as by major

# Business Value Proposition {.unnumbered}

We have created a business value proposition for the FSB Career Services that reports to Kirk Bogard, the Associate Vice President for Development and External Relations in FSB.They are interested in how the FSB Career Services advising team can more effectively direct their efforts to properly serve the almost 5,000 students in FSB.


## Visualization {.unnumbered}

## Text {.unnumbered}

**1. Define the client or audience for your data analysis solution.**

- The FSB Career Services team that reports to Kirk Bogard, Associate Vice President for Development and External Relations in FSB.

- We are tasked with assisting with their duties by providing insight and recommendations on how Careers Services can best advise FSB undergraduate students.

- In context, we have been asked to explore the macro placement and salary trends FSB has seen over the past three years.



**2. Define the client jobs. What jobs are your clients trying to get done? Use a separate bullet point for each job you intend to help your customer get done. Be specific.**

- Adjusting advising efforts to reflect placement and salary trends.

- Effectively aid students in their pursuit of careers.

- Understand how students of various majors differ in job placement and expected salary.

- Develop solutions that equip FSB students to place well and earn high.


**3. Add pains. What are the pains before, during, and after your customer is trying to get their jobs done? Create a bullet point for every specific pain.**

- There are about 5,000 students in FSB and the staff tasked with advising them is significantly smaller (4) so it is impossible to adequately and thoroughly advise all 5,000 students.

- Some majors may have an easier time placing in jobs or earning higher salaries. Career Services would like to know which ones, or else they can’t focus on those in the most need. 

- Career Services can’t prepare students who may have a more difficult time in their job search or inform students with accurate salary expectations if they don’t know which majors are experiencing hiring surges or hiring decreases based on recent trends. 


**4. Describe your intended solution. Give a bullet point for each major element of your product or solution.**

- Compare the data of both job placement trends and salary trends over the three year time period provided.

- Deliver an analysis to show job placement and salary trends over time across the entirety of FSB, as well as drilling down to explore results by major.

- Create visualizations that illustrate these trends in an understandable and digestible way to show changes in trends by major and be able to easily compare the most recent differences in the department.


**5. What are the painkillers from your solution? List out those things in your solution that can kill the pain points of your client.**

- Creating understandable and easily comparable visualizations allows the small team of career advisors to more effectively and efficiently direct their efforts across the vast student body so they can focus on those in the most need.

- Deliver a sound understanding of placement result trends by major through the creation of visualizations that compare changes and reveal trends over the three years, informing Career Services of which majors are most in need of advising. 

- Be able to provide Career Services with relevant job market information based on trends identified in the past three years to allow them to help students understand personal market value based on their major and education at FSB.

**6. Add gains. What are the gains that your customer expects to get or will be surprised to benefit from your solution?**

- The Career Services team will be able to equip students with the necessary insights and information to prepare them for their job search.

- Career Services will be able to effectively target advising efforts toward students in the most need.

- Career Services will be able to provide students with expectations that will be more accurate to reality regarding career search, ideally resulting in less reliance on the advising team, allowing them time to help even more students.


**7. What are the gain creators? List out the items that will add additional value to your customer, above and beyond addressing their current pain points.**

- The analysis over time and subsequent visualizations will be easily reproducible. Career Services will be able to routinely update them year after year with fresh data to track the placement and salary trends well into the future as needed.

- The analysis over time and visualizations will allow Career Services to track their own progress in their efforts, providing feedback if used over time on how their newly directed efforts have impacted placement and salary trends.

## Data Cleaning {.unnumbered}

```{r}
## LOADING DATA##
FSB  = readRDS("FSB_BI_Survey_2019_2021.rds")

head(FSB)
```

For the purposes of our analysis, we are looking at the job placement and salary trends for FSB graduates as a whole and by major. For this, we should only be looking at students who are intending to enter the workforce and exclude those who's plans deviate from that course (i.e. continuing their education). 

```{r}
unique(FSB$survey_plans)
```

## Exploring Context {.unnumbered}
We want to look at various response to evaluate what context they provide to our analysis and whether they would be useful to keep in the final data set we use.

Primarily, we want to look at responses in the survey_plans field because we believe that will be a strong way to filter out observations that have no correlation to the job placement and salary trends. 

For example: "seeking continuing education", "continuing education", "not seeking employment", NA are assumed not relevant to our purposes. If an individual is not actively trying to get a job or accepting a job, then the data they provide will not be useful in determining job placement and salary trends.

Contrarily: "seeking employment", "accepted parttime job" and "accepted fulltime job" are assumed relevant to our purposes and will be included in the analysis. The data they provide will grant us insight on job placement and salary trends because they are actively attempting to secure jobs. We will need to impute missing values and clean any non-standardized responses (i.e. the company or city fields that have various capitilazation and spelling differences)
```{r}
## Exploring responses to evaluate context ##

FSB_self = FSB |> dplyr::filter(FSB$survey_plans == "self employed") 
# Does not appear relevant for our purposes. Only one response with this designation and it does not include values in the fields necessary for our analysis.

FSB_other = FSB |> dplyr::filter(FSB$survey_plans == "other") 
# Does not appear relevant for our purposes. No values for preferred field, location, salary, etc.

FSB_mil = FSB |> dplyr::filter(FSB$survey_plans == "military service")
# Does not appear relevant for our purposes. No values for preferred field, location, salary, and though they technically work for the military they have very limited responses in the company field

# remove unnecessary dfs
remove(FSB_other)
remove(FSB_self)
remove(FSB_mil)

```

Now that we have our list of response values we would like to filter on, we will now create our new data set

```{r}
# create a new data set that filters out irrelevant observations
FSB_job = FSB |> dplyr::filter(FSB$survey_plans %in%
                                 c("seeking employment", "accepted parttime job",
                                   "accepted fulltime job"))
```




## Counting Missing by Variable {.unnumbered}
```{r}
sapply(FSB_job, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
It seems clear that the survey responses contain a substantial amount of observations with missing values across the entirety of the survey fields. It is our conclusion that to omit responses with missing values would destroy any chance of pulling any meaningful analysis from the data. With that assumption, we will instead clean and impute missing values for fields necessary for our analysis.


## Imputation {.unnumbered}

### Mean Salary by Major {.unnumbered}

After examining the missing value counts, we noticed that survey_salary had a significant portion of missing values. With this being such an important part of our analysis, we felt it would be inappropriate to remove the observations with missing salary data. We know that common practice is to impute the mean of numerical variables and so we will impute salary based on the mean salary reported by major of the student. We chose to impute by major to account for the variation in salary influenced by major (some majors may have a higher average salary).


```{r}
pacman::p_load("dplyr")
FSB_job = FSB_job |> 
  group_by(major1) |> 
  dplyr::mutate( survey_salary = ifelse(is.na(survey_salary), mean(survey_salary, na.rm = TRUE), survey_salary)) |> 
  ungroup()
```

Now, since we included the reported plan value of "seeking employment, any observation with that plan value will have a null value for salary. Since these individuals do not have jobs, we will impute $0 as their salary.

```{r}
FSB_job = FSB_job |> 
  dplyr::mutate( survey_salary = ifelse(survey_plans == "seeking employment", 0, survey_salary))
```

We will check our missing count for salary once again

```{r}
sum(is.na(FSB_job$survey_salary))
```

There is still one missing value in this column. We will subset to find this observation

```{r}
print(FSB_job[which(is.na(FSB_job$survey_salary)), ])
```
```{r}
# view a collection of observations with this specific major1 value
MandO = FSB_job |> dplyr::filter(FSB_job$major1 == "Management and Organizations") 
```

It appears that the missing value that remains is due to the fact that only one observation with this given major1 value is recorded, and they failed to report their salary. This means that mean imputation by major will not be able to fill in their salary and therefore the data this observation provides is not relevant to our purposes. We will remove this observation.

```{r}
# remove unnecessary df
remove(MandO)

# drop the observation
FSB_job =  FSB_job[-(which(is.na(FSB_job$survey_salary))), ]

# check missing
sum(is.na(FSB_job$survey_salary))
```
**NEED TO DECIDE ON survey_offers**



### Imputing Categorical {.unnumbered}

For the remainder of relevant variables with missing values, we will impute the value of "Missing" to fill any null values.

```{r}
FSB_job = FSB_job |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    survey_city = ifelse(is.na(survey_city), "Missing", survey_city),
    survey_company = ifelse(is.na(survey_company), "Missing", survey_company),
    survey_pref_field = ifelse(is.na(survey_pref_field), "Missing", survey_pref_field),
    survey_pref_loc = ifelse(is.na(survey_pref_loc), "Missing", survey_pref_loc),
    survey_state = ifelse(is.na(survey_state), "Missing", survey_state)
    )

# check missing
sapply(FSB_job, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
