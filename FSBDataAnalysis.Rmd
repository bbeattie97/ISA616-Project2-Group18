# FSB Data Analysis: Group 17b {.unnumbered}

# "What are the macro placement and salay trends FSB is seeing over the past three years" {.unnumbered}

-   Are our placement results going up / down / steady?
-   Salary trends?
-   Kirk would like to see this for FSB overall as well as by major

# Business Value Proposition {.unnumbered}

We have created a business value proposition for the FSB Career Services that reports to Kirk Bogard, the Associate Vice President for Development and External Relations in FSB.They are interested in how the FSB Career Services advising team can more effectively direct their efforts to properly serve the almost 5,000 students in FSB.

## Text {.unnumbered}

**1. Define the client or audience for your data analysis solution.**

- The FSB Career Services team that reports to Kirk Bogard, Associate Vice President for Development and External Relations in FSB.

- We are tasked with assisting with their duties by providing insight and recommendations on how Careers Services can best advise FSB undergraduate students.

- In context, we have been asked to explore the macro placement and salary trends FSB has seen over the past three years.



**2. Define the client jobs. What jobs are your clients trying to get done? Use a separate bullet point for each job you intend to help your customer get done. Be specific.**

- Adjusting advising efforts to reflect placement and salary trends.

- Effectively aid students in their pursuit of careers.

- Understand how students of various majors differ in job placement and expected salary.

- Develop solutions that equip FSB students to place well and earn high.


**3. Add pains. What are the pains before, during, and after your customer is trying to get their jobs done? Create a bullet point for every specific pain.**

- There are about 5,000 students in FSB and the staff tasked with advising them is significantly smaller (4) so it is impossible to adequately and thoroughly advise all 5,000 students.

- Some majors may have an easier time placing in jobs or earning higher salaries. Career Services would like to know which ones, or else they can’t focus on those in the most need. 

- Career Services can’t prepare students who may have a more difficult time in their job search or inform students with accurate salary expectations if they don’t know which majors are experiencing hiring surges or hiring decreases based on recent trends. 


**4. Describe your intended solution. Give a bullet point for each major element of your product or solution.**

- Compare the data of both job placement trends and salary trends over the three year time period provided.

- Deliver an analysis to show job placement and salary trends over time across the entirety of FSB, as well as drilling down to explore results by major.

- Create visualizations that illustrate these trends in an understandable and digestible way to show changes in trends by major and be able to easily compare the most recent differences in the department.


**5. What are the painkillers from your solution? List out those things in your solution that can kill the pain points of your client.**

- Creating understandable and easily comparable visualizations allows the small team of career advisors to more effectively and efficiently direct their efforts across the vast student body so they can focus on those in the most need.

- Deliver a sound understanding of placement result trends by major through the creation of visualizations that compare changes and reveal trends over the three years, informing Career Services of which majors are most in need of advising. 

- Be able to provide Career Services with relevant job market information based on trends identified in the past three years to allow them to help students understand personal market value based on their major and education at FSB.

**6. Add gains. What are the gains that your customer expects to get or will be surprised to benefit from your solution?**

- The Career Services team will be able to equip students with the necessary insights and information to prepare them for their job search.

- Career Services will be able to effectively target advising efforts toward students in the most need.

- Career Services will be able to provide students with expectations that will be more accurate to reality regarding career search, ideally resulting in less reliance on the advising team, allowing them time to help even more students.


**7. What are the gain creators? List out the items that will add additional value to your customer, above and beyond addressing their current pain points.**

- The analysis over time and subsequent visualizations will be easily reproducible. Career Services will be able to routinely update them year after year with fresh data to track the placement and salary trends well into the future as needed.

- The analysis over time and visualizations will allow Career Services to track their own progress in their efforts, providing feedback if used over time on how their newly directed efforts have impacted placement and salary trends.

Dropping Unnecessary variables
```{r}
FSB1 = subset(FSB, select = -c(`Business Direct Admit`, `Dean's List`, `First Generation College Stdnt`, `FSB Scholars`, `Honors Program`, `President's List`, `Study Abroad Courtesy Account`, `Transfer Work (Pre-Banner)`, `Cum Laude`, `Magna Cum Laude`, `Summa Cum Laude`, `University Honors`, `UniversityHonors w/Distinction`, `minor1`, `minor2`, `IPEDS.Race.Ethnicity`, `Gender`, `latin_honors`, `survey_company`, `survey_gradprogram`, `survey_gradschool`, `survey_internfour`, `survey_internone`, `survey_internthree`, `survey_interntwo` , `survey_state`))

We decided to remove the columns that were not going to be used and would have added complexity to the data frame we would be working with. 
This helps us to only see variables that could effect job placement, salary, and major. We decided to keep city data to hold constant in our analysis. We did this because we believe that location could have a major effect on salary. We also kept GPA range to hold constant and we believed that it also would have a large effect on placement and salary. 


```{r}
unique(FSB1$survey_city)
```
```{r}
state_mapping = c("ohio" = "OH", "Ohio" = "OH")
```


counting number of NAs in salary
```{r}
sum(is.na(FSB1$survey_salary))
```

Imputing mean salary by major
```{r}
pacman::p_load("dplyr")
FSB2 <- FSB1 %>%
  group_by(major1) %>%
  dplyr::mutate( survey_salary= ifelse(is.na(survey_salary), mean(survey_salary, na.rm = TRUE), survey_salary)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

From looking at our data we found that about half of our data for salary was NA. With this being such an important part of our analysis we felt it would be inappropriate to remove the observations with missing salary data. We know that common practice is to impute the mean of numerical variables and so we imputed salary based on the mean by major of the student. We chose to impute by major to cover for the variation in salary influenced by major.
